# Ag Heritage Museum
Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript template for Ag Heritage Museum using the Foundation 5 framework

---

The markup in this project uses and includes Foundation 5.1. It has no external dependencies and (currently) no "build" process. Just clone, branch, and code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Check out a new branch (`assembling`, at this point) to begin your work.
3. Run the following shell commands (if the condition applies):
  - `npm install -g grunt-cli` (if running `grunt -v` returns an error)
  - `npm install` (if the assembling branch doesn't contain a node_modules directory)
  - `gem install compass` (if running `compass -v` returns an error)
  - `bower install` (if the assembling branch doesn't contain a node_modules directory)
4. Write code!
5. Push your commits back to `assembling` once the feature is complete.
